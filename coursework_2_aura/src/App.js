                This project attempts to examine the relationship between air quality collected by a sensor and weather patterns within urban areas.
                This relationship has the potential to create urban environments that adapt and respond dynamically to weather, resulting in better living conditions.

                A week-long experiment was setup, with recorded data, data analysis, and potential improvements shown below.

          <p>- Data collection from the sensor took place only at one location, which was within the boundary of interior and exterior spaces of an urban apartment. For future experiments,
          more robust data collection could arise from placing multiple sensors around the observation space (e.g. bedroom, living room, garage), in order to derive more information.</p>
          <p>- Correlation and causation in such experiments cannot be confused, and data collected for this experiment is emperically seen to be limited. More work / data collection is
          required to derive more concrete and confident results.</p>
          <p>- Data collection reliability may also be improved by setting up multiple case studies, such as identical set-ups in different locations / cities. This will benefit the search
          for whether true correlation between the data sources concerned exist.</p>
