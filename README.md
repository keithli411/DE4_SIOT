**Project aura - January 2020**

**DE4 Sensing IoT Coursework - Keith Li**

Coursework 1: Use `airquality.py` and `weatherRequest.py` scripts on Raspberry Pi (with sensor) and Windows Command-line (with your API key and forecastiopy3 wrapper library from Dark Sky).

Coursework 2: Initialise a React environment with the `coursework_2_aura` directory level and use `npm start` to compile web app and execute on a web browser (duplicate initialisation files may need to be removed). Main Javascript React code can be found in `coursework_2_aura/src`. Check dependent npm packages in `packages.json`.

Weather Data is powered by Dark Sky: https://darksky.net/dev/docs
